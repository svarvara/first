Hello
Is anybody home
I'm feeling so alone

I've been waiting all my life
To meet someone like you
It's a bittersweet sensation
Yes you think that we are through
You should have paid a visit to
The love I had inside
Now I'm left with my obsession
Where will you lay your heart tonight

Hello
I'm feeling so alone
My heart is like a stone
I feel like I am the only one with a broken heart
Hello
Is anybody home
I've been hanging by the phone
I wonder if I'm the only one with a broken heart
Hello
